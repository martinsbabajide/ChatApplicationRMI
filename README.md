# ChatApplicationRMI

This application is a console based application, that is based on client-server architecture and it utilizes the use of multithreading. This application has a single server that multiple clients/users connect to and the other users are notified when a user joins the chat room, and the server also is notified when clients connect, the users have different ID they can choose to represent themselves and the other clients are notified when a user joins and exits the group. The users are also permitted to send multiple messages. 

	Features to be implemented in this application would be to create a text file to save the message log, a GUI to add better user interface, different text color of each user so for easily differentiation, also, a unicast and multicast feature which enables user to send a message or file to a particular client(Unicast), a blockcast which enables user to send a message or file to all clients except a particular person and also a size restriction on the file size in the future.
